The Jekyll Starter Kit comes ready to use out of the box - simply fork or clone this repository, and you can start developing your Jekyll site right away. Navigate to the root folder using the command line, and type in `jekyll serve`. If you would like to start with a blank slate, then delete the contents in the `index.html` file and the sample code in the `all.sass` file.

### Assets

This folder contains all of the images, CSS, and JavaScript for the site, and within these folders, there is some structure that will help in organizing all of your assets.

#### CSS

This folder is further subdivided into `1-tools`, `2-base`, and `3-sections`. The 'tools' folder can be used to store CSS libraries or generic CSS files that you may have that you use for your other projects. The 'base' folder is used to store any CSS relating to styling HTML tags, for example. The 'sections' folder is the one that you will probably use the most, and will be where you store your main CSS styling. Generally, I try to have one SASS file corresponding to an HTML file in the `includes` or `layouts` folder.
