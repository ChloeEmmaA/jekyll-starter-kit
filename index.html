This folder is further subdivided into `1-tools`, `2-base`, and `3-sections`. The 'tools' folder can be used to store CSS libraries or generic CSS files that you may have that you use for your other projects. The 'base' folder is used to store any CSS relating to styling HTML tags, for example. The 'sections' folder is the one that you will probably use the most, and will be where you store your main CSS styling. Generally, I try to have one SASS file corresponding to an HTML file in the `includes` or `layouts` folder.
