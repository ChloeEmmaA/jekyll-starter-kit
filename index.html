### Assets

This folder contains all of the images, CSS, and JavaScript for the site, and within these folders, there is some structure that will help in organizing all of your assets.

The 'tools' folder can be used to store CSS libraries or generic CSS files that you may have that you use for your other projects.

The 'sections' folder is the one that you will probably use the most, and will be where you store your main CSS styling. Generally, I try to have one SASS file corresponding to an HTML file in the `includes` or `layouts` folder.
